## About the Web application

MyRecipeBook is a web application made for displaying recipes while using measurements customised to your preference. At the same time, users are able to share their recipes to this website.

User group:
- People who are willing to share their recipes to others
- People who enjoy cooking
- People who are willing to try new recipes

## Technologies

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App -->
- **React**: For building the user interface and front-end.
- **Material UI**: For implementing pre-designed UI components and ensuring consistent styling across the application.
- **Node.js**: For back-end services.
- **MongoDB and Mongoose**: For database management.
- **Figma**: Used for designing wireframes the user interface. 

<!-- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). -->

## Setup

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
To run this React application, you need to install all the required packages and dependencies. This is necessary because the source code relies on external libraries and modules that are listed in the package.json file.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.


## Approach
This project followed an **Agile** development methodology, with **daily scrum** meetings to ensure progress and collaboration. The team was divided into three roles: **Product Owner**, **Scrum Master**, and **Developers**. 

We completed the project over **2 sprints**, each lasting **2 weeks**, focusing on delivering a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**.

### Design
The design phase began by creating wireframes via **Figma** based on the requirements provided by the Product Owner. This allowed us to visualize the user interface and the essential features for the MVP. These wireframes guided the development of both the frontend and backend, ensuring alignment with the project's goals.

### Development
#### Frontend:

The frontend was developed as a **Single Page Application (SPA)**  using **React**, implementing component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.

We adhered to the **Single Responsibility Principle** by ensuring each component had a specific function, improving clarity and making the code easier to test.

<!-- Code styles followed ESLint and Prettier for consistent formatting and clean code. -->

#### Backend:

The backend was designed to follow the REST API pattern, keeping the services modular and easy to extend.
We used MVC (Model-View-Controller) as the primary design pattern to separate business logic from presentation and routing, ensuring a clean architecture.

#### Integration & Deployment:

After completing individual features, we integrated the frontend and backend, ensuring smooth communication via API endpoints.


<!-- We used a continuous integration (CI) process for testing and automated deployment to ensure the code worked across all environments. -->

#### Version Control and Code Management

We used **Github** for **version control**, following a branch-based workflow to manage feature development, code reviews, and merge requests. This ensured that the codebase remained stable throughout the project.
