      "Put the chicken in the flour bowl and cover with the flour",
      "Dunk the chicken into the beaten eggs until covered, let the excess drip off a bit",

      "If any of the bowls run out before all the chicken is crumbed, add some more as necessary",
      "Any remaining breadcrumbs left in the container (and not in the bowl that had chicken and egg touch it!) can be stored for future use",
      "Bake the crumbed chicken in an oven at 180C fan-forced for around 40-50 minutes, turning once",
